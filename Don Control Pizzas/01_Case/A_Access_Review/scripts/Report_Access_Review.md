# Access Review - Report

**Period reviewed**: last 30 days
**Systems (critical)**: POS, CRM
**Data sources**: users.csv, roles.csv, assignments.csv (full population)
**Method**: join user–role–assignment exports → flag inactive/orphan access and high-privilege accounts (priv_level ≥ 8) → route approvals/remediation via ticketing (JML).

---

## KPIs (Targets / SLAs)
**Coverage**: 100% of critical apps reviewed monthly
**Orphans**: 0 open orphan/inactive accounts after review
**High-privilege recertification**: 100% of admin roles re-approved monthly
**Closure time**: all findings closed in ≤ 30 days

---

## Current Results (This review cycle)
**Population tested**: 4 users / 5 assignments / 2 critical apps
**Coverage achieved**: 100% (POS, CRM included)

### Metrics

| Metric                              | Result                                     |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Orphan/inactive with access         | 1 (uid u002, role CRM_User)                |
| High-privilege accounts flagged (≥8)| 2 (u001 POS_Admin, u004 CRM_Admin)         |
| High-privilege re-approved this cycle | 0 / 2 (pending owner approval)            |
| Findings closed within ≤30 days     | In progress (targets set below)            |

### Finding Details

| ID   | User | Role       | Issue                             | Severity      | Planned ticket / owner | Due date   |
|------|------|------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|
| F-01 | u002 | CRM_User   | Orphan/inactive user with access  | High (Major)  | JML-001 / IAM Lead     | ≤ 7 days   |
| F-02 | u001 | POS_Admin  | High-privilege recertification required | Medium (Minor) | AR-002 / POS Owner     | ≤ 30 days  |
| F-03 | u004 | CRM_Admin  | High-privilege recertification required | Medium (Minor) | AR-003 / CRM Owner     | ≤ 30 days  |

**Control effectiveness (this cycle)**: Needs Improvement
**Rationale**: orphan detected (Major) and two admin approvals pending.

## Remediation Plan & Owners
**Remove orphan access (F-01)** — disable u002 in CRM and document approval (ticket JML-001). Owner: IAM Lead. SLA: ≤ 7 days.
**Recertify admin roles (F-02, F-03)** — POS/CRM owners to approve or downgrade privileges (tickets AR-002, AR-003). SLA: ≤ 30 days.
**Preventive step**: enforce monthly export + review cadence; add SoD checks in next cycle.
